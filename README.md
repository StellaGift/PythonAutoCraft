# Python Script Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various programming concepts and practical use cases. Each script is encapsulated in its own file, with its own unique filenames. Below is a brief overview of each script's purpose and functionality:

## `for0.py` - For Loop Example

This script demonstrates a basic `for` loop, iterating over a range of values (from 10 to 49) and excluding the last value. It showcases a simple delay using `time.sleep` and prints each iteration.

## `for1.py` - Password Generator

This script generates random passwords based on user-specified patterns. It prompts the user to input the desired password length and the number of passwords to generate. The passwords are constructed using a set of characters, and the script uses a nested `for` loop to generate the requested number of passwords.

## `ifthen0.py` - String Manipulation and Conditions

This script utilizes replacement fields, strings, and conditions. It prompts the user for their name and age, then prints a message based on their age. It showcases the use of `format` for string formatting and includes conditional statements to determine whether the user is old enough to vote.

## `ifthen1.py` - Number Guessing Game

This script implements a simple number guessing game where the user attempts to guess a predefined number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## `ifthen2.py` - Number Guessing Game with Attempts

This script extends the number guessing game, allowing the user two attempts to guess the correct number within a specified range.

## `ifthen3.py` - Concise Conditional Statement

A concise conditional statement script prompting the user to guess a number between 2 and 100. It provides feedback based on the user's guess, with a concise structure.

## `varAndstring.py` - Python Scripting Basics

An introductory script showcasing various Python scripting basics. It covers the use of strings, concatenation, and variables to create dynamic messages.

## `while0.py` - Iterating with a While Loop

This script uses a `while` loop to iterate over a variable, printing values from 0 to 40 with a slight delay between iterations.

## `while1.py` - Advanced While Loop Example

An advanced example of a `while` loop, potentially suitable for offensive security purposes. It demonstrates a loop for constructing strings incrementally, which could be applied in scenarios like buffer overflow scripting in red teaming and penetration testing.

**Note:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed to run these scripts. Simply execute each file individually to observe their functionality. Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these examples for educational and productivity purposes.
